# pong
simple python pong


## 🐛 to fix one day:
- Sometimes ball bounces several time on paddle
- Key "Up" and key "Down" allow a continuous mouvment which is not the case for key "s" and "w". User 2 is disadvantaged
- User's paddle can go outside of the screen range
- With current code, theorically, speed can become negative and trigger an error (in practice, would be hard as speed would be really high)
